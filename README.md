# Discord-Fake-Emotes-Tool
Turn Discord Nitro emotes into fake ones that can be used by anyone.

## How to save emotes
1. Right click Discord emote
2. From the context menu, select "Copy Link"
3. Paste the link into the input field, located at the top of website
*Once you have saved an emote, it should appear below the input bar*

## How to use saved emotes
1. Click the emote that you would like to use
2. Paste (Ctrl + V or Right click > Paste) into Discord, or wherever you want to use it, and send

**Note:** This will turn a Discord emote link into a .gif link but retains its original size to make it appear as a normal emote. Saved emotes do not get removed when the browser tab is closed.
